# About

This is a theme using colors from the [Catppuccin style guide](https://github.com/catppuccin/style-guide) for the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This theme covers my use case for the app. That said! Part of what makes Obsidian so fantastic is its many features and extended universe of user-created plugins. As time goes on, I would like to add more compatibility between the theme and some of the more popular plugins. Additionally, Obsidian now has a legacy editor. There be dragons, but none too bad: Most of the css was written before the new editor's beta. Currently the theme uses CSS from [Kepano's Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) plugin. That will change soon, but you may need to do some cmd/ctrl+p-ing in the meantime if you are used to buttons. (:

# Installation

The theme is not yet approved in the Obsidian theme store. In the mean time, brave users can download [Obsidian.css](https://github.com/mbeckrich/obsidian/blob/main/obsidian.css), rename the file `catppuccin.css` to prevent overwriting any preexisting themes, and place it in their Vault's configuration folder: `<Vault>/.obsidian/themes`. After that, it's as simple as opening your preferences in Obsidian, clicking the 'Appearance' tab, and pressing 'Manage' to select the theme.

# The shape of things to come

* Style Settings plugin compatibility
* Tweaks to improve theme consistency throughout UI
* Behind the scenes cleanup of scss/css
* Mobile version

PRs and constructive feedback more than welcome.

# Known issues

* Bullet indentations under checkboxes are not deep enough
* Some infrequently seen icons still need to be styled/replaced
* Legacy editor blockquote is not consistent with the new editor's
