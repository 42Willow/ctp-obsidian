## About

This theme covers my use case for the app. That said! Part of what makes Obsidian so fantastic is its many features and extended universe of user-created plugins. As time goes on, I would like to add more compatibility between the theme and some of the more popular plugins. Additionally, Obsidian now has a legacy editor. There be dragons, but none too bad: Most of the css was written before the new editor's beta. Currently the theme uses css from [Kepano's Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) plugin. That will change soon, but you may need to do some cmd/ctrl+p-ing in the meantime if you are used to buttons. (:

## Usage

### Obsidian theme store

To install from the Obsidian theme store:
Open Obisidian and go to `Preferences` >> `Appearance`, click `Manage` and scroll down to 'Community Themes.' Type 'Catppuccin' in the filter bar and then click 'Use' under the theme name.

### Manual

1. Download the [catppuccin.css](https://github.com/mbeckrich/obsidian/blob/main/obsidian.css) file
2. Put it under your Vault's configuration folder (e.g. `<vault>/.obsidian/themes/`)
3. Open Obisidian and go to `Preferences` >> `Appearance` >> `Manage`
4. Select `Catppuccin`

## Development

### The shape of things to come

+ [ ] Style Settings plugin compatibility
+ [ ] Tweaks to improve theme consistency throughout UI
+ [ ] Behind the scenes cleanup of scss/css
+ [ ] Mobile version

PRs and constructive feedback more than welcome.

### Known issues

* Bullet indentations under checkboxes are not deep enough
* Some infrequently seen icons still need to be styled/replaced
* Legacy editor blockquote is not consistent with the new editor's
